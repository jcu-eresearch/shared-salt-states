Nagios states for JCU
=====================

Semi-automated configuration for Nagios (NRPE) for JCU hosts.

This configuration requires the presence of custom Nagios plugins in
``/usr/local/lib/nagios/plugins`` to successfully run the state.  These files
can be managed by hand and cloned from private version control.
